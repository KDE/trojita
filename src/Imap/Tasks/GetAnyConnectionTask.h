/** @short Come up with a connection that is (at least) in the authenticated state

In contrast to OpenConnectionTask, this task merely looks at any existing connection
and returns it, unless there are no connections, in which case it creates a new one.

In order to prevent some funny ordering issues, this task will sleep until no other
Tasks are using the connection in question, effectively serializing commands. Note
that this aspect of behavior can (and most likely will) change in future in order to
better accommodate command pipelining. Another thing to note is that this "sleeping"
only waits stuff which got queued before this task, and that GetAnyConnection typically
finishes immediately, so the serialization effectively isn't here.
