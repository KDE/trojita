\chapter{Proposed Internet Drafts}
\label{sec:id-manuscripts}

This chapter contains full text of the Internet Drafts which I have submitted for community consideration.

The Internet Drafts are written in a custom document format which is the reason why these documents are presented in a
dedicated section rather than being included as regular chapters of this thesis.
