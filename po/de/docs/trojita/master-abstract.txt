Mobile IMAP: Implementing Advanced IMAP Features in the Trojita Qt E-Mail Client

Mobile environment imposes certain challenges to application development, from
limited hardware computing capacity and short battery life to expensive and
unreliable network connection.  Users expect the system to deal with network
interruptions and to conserve the limited resources automatically.  The base
IMAP protocol leaves much to be desired in order to be fully usable in such
environments.  Thankfully, certain extensions were adopted which allow an IMAP
application to limit the amount of transfered data, as well as to speed up
certain operations.  The goal of this proposed Master's thesis is to explore
various IMAP extensions, describe their design choices and objectives, survey
their real-world adoption, in terms of both client-side and server-side support,
evaluate their advantages for a mobile application, and implement the most
important ones in the Trojita Qt-based IMAP e-mail client, an application
developed as the author's bachelor thesis.
